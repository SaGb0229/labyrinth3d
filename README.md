# Labyrinth 3D - my fun with pyglet

The code launches an openGL-based little 3D first-person perspective game (kind of Doom-like) and let's the user control the area (just use arrow keys). It is just a small demo of pyglet library possibilities.

## Contents
- bricks.py - main code
- \*.jpg - graphic files (textures)

## Requirements
- pyglet
- graphic files located in the same directory as the bricks.py file
